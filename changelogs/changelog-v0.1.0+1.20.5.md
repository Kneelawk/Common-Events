Changes:

* Initial Common Events release.
* Added `Event<T>` type which can function just like Fabric/Quilt's `Event<T>` type, but also allows for
  annotation-based event registration.
* Added class scanner to allow for annotation-based registration based on configuration in a mod's `common-events.json`.
